# Radar Installation

http://poj.org/problem?id=1328

### Description

Assume the coasting is an infinite straight line. Land is in one side of coasting, sea in the other. Each small island is a point locating in the sea side. And any radar installation, locating on the coasting, can only cover d distance, so an island in the sea can be covered by a radius installation, if the distance between them is at most d.

We use Cartesian coordinate system, defining the coasting is the x-axis. The sea side is above x-axis, and the land side below. Given the position of each island in the sea, and given the distance of the coverage of the radar installation, your task is to write a program to find the minimal number of radar installations to cover all the islands. Note that the position of an island is represented by its x-y coordinates.

### 问题概述

用横轴上的雷达基站覆盖横轴上方的小岛

### 问题化简

每个岛都对应一个区间，这个区间内任意一点的雷达都可以覆盖小岛，因此题目中的所有小岛变成区间，求每个区间内有一个点，至少需要多少点。

### Input

The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each case contains two integers n (1<=n<=1000) and d, where n is the number of islands in the sea and d is the distance of coverage of the radar installation. This is followed by n lines each containing two integers representing the coordinate of the position of each island. Then a blank line follows to separate the cases.

The input is terminated by a line containing pair of zeros

### Output

For each test case output one line consisting of the test case number followed by the minimal number of radar installations needed. "-1" installation means no solution for that case.
