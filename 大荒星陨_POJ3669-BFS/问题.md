# 大荒星陨 POJ 3669

http://poj.org/problem?id=3669

### Description

Bessie hears that an extraordinary meteor shower is coming; reports say that these meteors will crash into earth and destroy anything they hit. Anxious for her safety, she vows to find her way to a safe location (one that is never destroyed by a meteor) . She is currently grazing at the origin in the coordinate plane and wants to move to a new, safer location while avoiding being destroyed by meteors along her way.

The reports say that *M* meteors (1 ≤ *M* ≤ 50,000) will strike, with meteor *i* will striking point (*Xi*, *Yi*) (0 ≤ *Xi* ≤ 300; 0 ≤ *Yi* ≤ 300) at time *Ti* (0 ≤ *Ti* ≤ 1,000). Each meteor destroys the point that it strikes and also the four rectilinearly adjacent lattice points.

Bessie leaves the origin at time 0 and can travel in the first quadrant and parallel to the axes at the rate of one distance unit per second to any of the (often 4) adjacent rectilinear points that are not yet destroyed by a meteor. She cannot be located on a point at any time greater than or equal to the time it is destroyed).

Determine the minimum time it takes Bessie to get to a safe place.

### 题目大意

300 * 300的网格上，有的地方在一定时间会被陨石击中，人不能在击中时和击中后待在那个地方，人从原点出发，如何走才能一直保持不被击中，求最短路径的长度。

### 解题思路

处理好三个地点之间的关系：安全地点、暂时安全地点、已走过地点，使用BFS搜索，如果是安全地点则结束，如果不是，则朝4个方向走，要求是暂时安全且没走过的地点。

一定要注意不能走回头路，否则会超时。

### Input

\* Line 1: A single integer: *M*
\* Lines 2..*M*+1: Line *i*+1 contains three space-separated integers: *Xi*, *Yi*, and *Ti*

### Output

\* Line 1: The minimum time it takes Bessie to get to a safe place or -1 if it is impossible.
