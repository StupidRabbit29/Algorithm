# Lake Counting POJ 2386

http://poj.org/problem?id=2386

### Description

Due to recent rains, water has pooled in various places in Farmer John's field, which is represented by a rectangle of N x M (1 <= N <= 100; 1 <= M <= 100) squares. Each square contains either water ('W') or dry land ('.'). Farmer John would like to figure out how many ponds have formed in his field. A pond is a connected set of squares with water in them, where a square is considered adjacent to all eight of its neighbors.

Given a diagram of Farmer John's field, determine how many ponds he has.

关于水坑的相连：一个W周围的8个位置如果也是W，则可以连起来，算作一个水坑。因此想到了用穷竭搜索的方式来统计一个水坑，这里选择了用DFS，因为好写程序，栈的形式和递归函数调用很相似，如果用BFS，还要想存储结构。

### Input

\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M

\* Lines 2..N+1: M characters per line representing one row of Farmer John's field. Each character is either 'W' or '.'. The characters do not have spaces between them.

### Output

\* Line 1: The number of ponds in Farmer John's field.

### Sample Input

```
10 12
W........WW.
.WWW.....WWW
....WW...WW.
.........WW.
.........W..
..W......W..
.W.W.....WW.
W.W.W.....W.
.W.W......W.
..W.......W.
```

### Sample Output

```
3
```

### Hint

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are three ponds: one in the upper left, one in the lower left,and one along the right side.
